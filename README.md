# Grather-data-from-api

in this minior project we are learn to how to grather data from API using Api Key and import in jupyter
📌 Project Overview
This project gathers data from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, specifically top-rated movies, using an API key. The fetched data is retrieved in JSON format and converted into a CSV file for further analysis.

🛠 Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install requests pandas
🔑 How to Get an API Key
To use the TMDB API, follow these steps:

Create an account at TMDB Website.
Navigate to Settings → API.
Request an API Key and copy it for use.
🚀 How to Run the Script
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tmdb-movie-data.git
cd tmdb-movie-data
Open the Jupyter Notebook (tmdb_data.ipynb) and replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual TMDB API key.
Run the script to fetch data and convert it to CSV.
Alternatively, you can run the Python script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python fetch_tmdb.py --api_key YOUR_API_KEY
🗂️ JSON to CSV Conversion
The TMDB API returns data in JSON format. This script processes the JSON response and saves it as a CSV file (tmdb_top_movies.csv).

Example code snippet for conversion:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd
import json

# Load JSON data

with open('movies.json', 'r') as f:
data = json.load(f)

# Convert to DataFrame and save as CSV

df = pd.DataFrame(data['results'])
df.to_csv('tmdb_top_movies.csv', index=False)
📦 Data Storage
Fetched JSON data is stored in movies.json.
Processed CSV data is saved in tmdb_top_movies.csv.
📊 Example API Response
Sample JSON response from TMDB API:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"page": 1,
"results": [
{
"title": "The Shawshank Redemption",
"vote_average": 8.7,
"release_date": "1994-09-23"
}
]
}
⚠️ Error Handling & Limitations
If the API key is invalid, an error message is displayed.
TMDB rate limits requests to prevent excessive usage. If you exceed the limit, wait before retrying.
✨ Future Improvements
Automate daily data updates.
Store data in a database instead of a CSV file.
Add genre-based filtering for better insights.
